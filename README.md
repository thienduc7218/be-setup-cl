# Backend Setup Checklist

## Git Rules
- [ ] Protect the "main" branch to prevent force pushes.
- [ ] Ensure updates to "main" are only made by Merge Requests (MR) or Pull Requests (PR).
- [ ] Each MR/PR should pass CI/CD checks.
- [ ] Link each MR/PR to a specific task ID for tracking.

## Database Configuration
- [ ] Establish a connection to the database, preferably Postgres.
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for efficient database access.
- [ ] Set up database migrations and seed scripts to manage schema changes.

## ORM Setup
- [ ] Utilize an ORM, such as Prisma or TypeORM.
- [ ] Define models and relationships clearly within the ORM framework.
- [ ] Implement lazy and eager loading to optimize database queries.

## Code Quality and Styling
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier for consistent code styling.
- [ ] Implement linting rules specific to your codebase.
- [ ] Conduct code reviews focused on code quality and style adherence.

## Environment Configuration
- [ ] Categorize environment files (.env) for different stages like development, testing, and production.
- [ ] Ensure sensitive information is not stored in the codebase.
- [ ] Use environment variables for configuration management.

## API Management
- [ ] Implement Swagger for API documentation.
- [ ] Configure API prefix and versioning (e.g., `/api/v1`) to support future changes without disrupting existing clients.

## Error Handling
- [ ] Set up a robust exception filter for error handling.
- [ ] Log errors with sufficient context for debugging.
- [ ] Define a global error-handling strategy.

## Testing Frameworks
- [ ] Configure unit testing and end-to-end (e2e) test settings.
- [ ] Achieve a minimum coverage threshold for new code (suggest 80%).

## Containerization and Deployment
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile and Docker Compose for containerization.
- [ ] Incorporate multi-stage builds in Docker for optimized deployment images.
- [ ] Integrate CI/CD configuration file for automated builds and deployments.

## Documentation
- [ ] Update README with comprehensive instructions to bootstrap the app locally.
- [ ] Provide guidelines on contributing to the codebase.
